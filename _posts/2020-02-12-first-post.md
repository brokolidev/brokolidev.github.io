One day I try to find some information to solve programmatic problems, or bugs, and I found this page.

[Vue Laravel SPA] <https://stannlee.github.io/vue-laravel-spa/>

Firstly, I kind of disappointed because I was thinking about creating the same thing.
Secondly, I realize that the domain looks little bit strange. It was github.io, not github.com.
So I started to find information about github.io and github pages and found a github page tutorial blog. now I finally got here writing the first blog post.

I am going to post some peice of my works. There are many blogs and tutorials on the internet you can easily find but I think only few of those articles are useful because it doesn't explain from the start(Which case can cause this kind of problems) to the end(what's the idea of solving this kind of problems and how it can be applied in real world)

My first programming language was PHP and I am stiil working with it. So basically most of my post are going to be related with PHP and Laravel. Also front end development is getting more important so recently I am learning Vue JS and try to rebuild my work with it at the same time. Python is also quite interesting and easy to learn language and very popular this days and I have several project which Python takes care of it.

Okay let's get it!
